A New Thai Social Media Corpus for Depression and Anxiety Detection with Fine-grained Emotion Intensity Annotations

This corpus is part of my PhD research, “Exploring Emotion Timeline Patterns in Social Media for Automatic Identification of Depression and Anxiety.” It contains chronological tweets from Thai users, with each user tagged with depression and anxiety labels. The corpus also includes emotion-intensity labels across 26 fine-grained categories for each tweet, annotated manually by human experts.

The corpus contains two files: one providing user information and the other containing users’ chronological tweets.

The user information file (users_anonym.csv) provides depression and anxiety labels for each user. For both labels, a value of 0 indicates the absence of depression or anxiety, while a value of 1 indicates the presence of the condition.

The tweets file (timelines_anonym.csv) contains the tweeting timelines of each user. Each tweet is tagged with a user ID, timestamp, and emotion-intensity labels.

To protect users’ privacy, all sensitive information has been replaced with pseudonyms. This includes names, addresses, dates, places of work or study, job titles, salaries, telephone numbers, fax numbers, account numbers, certificate or licence numbers, email addresses, social media profile names (or handles), user mentions, website URLs, IP addresses, vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, and other personal details.
